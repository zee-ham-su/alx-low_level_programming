0x14. C - Bit manipulation


Working with data is important to programming, and bit manipulation is a crucial data handling ability.

You may find a selection of C programmes that illustrate different bit manipulation strategies in this repository, together with ALX tasks that will aid in my comprehension and application of these principles.
Bit manipulation enables effective data storage and manipulation and, in some circumstances, significantly enhances programme performance.

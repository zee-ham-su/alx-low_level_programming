0x17. C - Doubly linked lists


Sure, here is a paraphrase of the text you provided:

Doubly linked lists are a data structure that consists of a
sequence of nodes, where each node contains two pointers:
one to the previous node and one to the next node.
This allows for traversal in both directions, which makes
operations such as insertion and deletion more flexible.

In contrast, singly linked lists only have a pointer
to the next node. This means that traversal can only be
done in one direction, which makes operations such as insertion
and deletion more difficult.

Doubly linked lists are more complex than singly linked lists,
but they offer greater flexibility and performance.




Each node in a doubly linked list contains three fields: data,
previous, and next. The data field stores the data for the node,
the previous field points to the previous node in the list,
and the next field points to the next node in the list.
Doubly linked lists can be traversed in both directions, which means
that you can start at any node in the list and iterate
forward or backward to the end of the list.
Doubly linked lists are more complex to implement than
singly linked lists, but they offer greater flexibility
and performance.

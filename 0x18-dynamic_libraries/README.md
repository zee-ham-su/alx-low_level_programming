This README provides an overview of dynamic libraries in the C programming language. It explains what dynamic libraries are, how to create them, and how to use them in your C programs.



 Dynamic libraries, also known as shared libraries, are a type of library that is loaded at runtime by the programs that use them. This allows multiple programs to share the same library code, reducing duplication and improving overall system efficiency.


Dynamic libraries offer several advantages over static libraries, including:

Code sharing: Dynamic libraries allow multiple programs to share the same code in memory, reducing the overall memory footprint.
Run-time flexibility: Dynamic libraries can be loaded and unloaded at runtime, providing greater flexibility compared to static libraries that are linked at compile time.
Modularity: Dynamic libraries promote modularity by separating reusable code into distinct units.
